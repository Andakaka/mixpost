## Requirements

* Laravel Framework [^9.0, ^10.0]
* PHP 8.1 or higher
* Database (eg: MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLite)
* Redis 6.2 or higher
* Web Server (eg: Apache, Nginx, IIS)
* URL Rewrite (eg: mod_rewrite for Apache)

## Installation

If you have experience with Laravel and PHP, but don't want to install Mixpost in an existing Laravel application, you can use our standalone app. This standalone app is a regular Laravel app, which Mixpost has been preinstalled with. You can [use Composer to create this standalone app](https://github.com/inovector/MixpostApp).

If you already have a Laravel (9 or 10) application, you may use Composer to install Mixpost into your Laravel project:

```bash
composer require inovector/mixpost
```

After installing the Mixpost package, you may execute:

```bash
php artisan mixpost:install
```

To ensure that these assets get republished each time Mixpost is updated, we strongly advise you to add the following command to the `post-update-cmd` of the scripts section of your `composer.json`.

```bash
"scripts": {
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@php artisan mixpost:publish-assets --force=true"
    ]
}
```

Mixpost uses [Job Batching](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues#job-batching) and you should create a database migration
to build a table to contain meta information about your job batches.

If your application does not yet have this table, it may be generated using the:

```bash
php artisan queue:batches-table
```

Run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=mixpost-config
```

Mixpost has the ability to generate images from video while uploading a video file. This would not be possible without
FFmpeg installed on your server.
You need to follow FFmpeg installation instructions on their [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

After installation, depending on the operating system, you need to set the `ffmpeg_path` and `ffprobe_path` in the
Mixpost config file.

Default folder path: `/usr/bin/`. If FFmpeg is there, there is no need to change it.

```php
/*
 * FFMPEG & FFProbe binaries paths, only used if you try to generate video thumbnails
 */
'ffmpeg_path' => env('FFMPEG_PATH', '/usr/bin/ffmpeg'),
'ffprobe_path' => env('FFPROBE_PATH', '/usr/bin/ffprobe'),
```

## Install Horizon

Mixpost handles various tasks in a queued way via [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/horizon). If your
application doesn't have Horizon installed yet,
follow [their installation instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/horizon#installation).

After Horizon is installed, don't forget to set `QUEUE_CONNECTION` in your `.env` file to `redis`.

`config/horizon.php` should have been created in your project. In this config file, you must add a block
named `mixpost-heavy` to both the `production` and `local` environment.

```php
    'environments' => [
        'production' => [
            'supervisor-1' => [
                'maxProcesses' => 10,
                'balanceMaxShift' => 1,
                'balanceCooldown' => 3,
            ],
            'mixpost-heavy' => [
                'connection' => 'mixpost-redis',
                'queue' => ['publish-post'],
                'balance' => 'auto',
                'processes' => 8,
                'tries' => 1,
                'timeout' => 60 * 60,
            ],
        ],

        'local' => [
            'supervisor-1' => [
                'maxProcesses' => 3,
            ],
            'mixpost-heavy' => [
                'connection' => 'mixpost-redis',
                'queue' => ['publish-post'],
                'balance' => 'auto',
                'processes' => 3,
                'tries' => 1,
                'timeout' => 60 * 60,
            ],
        ],
    ],
```

In the `config/queue.php` file you must add the `mixpost-redis` connection:

```php
'connections' => [

    // ...

   'mixpost-redis' => [
        'driver' => 'redis',
        'connection' => 'default',
        'queue' => env('REDIS_QUEUE', 'default'),
        'retry_after' => 11 * 60,
        'block_for' => null,
    ],
```

Don't forget running `php artisan horizon`. In production, you need a way to keep your `horizon` processes running. For
this reason, you need to configure a process
monitor [Supervisor](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues#supervisor-configuration) that can detect when your `horizon`
processes exit and automatically restart them.

Example of supervisor config:

```bash
[program:mixpost_horizon]
process_name=%(program_name)s
command=php /path-to-your-project/artisan horizon
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=your_user_name
stopwaitsecs=3600
```

## Schedule the commands

In the console kernel (`app/Console/Kernel.php`), you should schedule this command.

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // ...
    $schedule->command('mixpost:run-scheduled-posts')->everyMinute();
    $schedule->command('mixpost:import-account-data')->everyTwoHours();
    $schedule->command('mixpost:import-account-audience')->everyThreeHours();
    $schedule->command('mixpost:process-metrics')->everyThreeHours();
    $schedule->command('mixpost:delete-old-data')->daily();
}
```

Don't forget to add a cron that running the scheduler:

`* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

## Add authorization to Mixpost UI

Mixpost does not come with any user management, we assume that you already provide this in your own app. You can use a
gate check to determine who can access Mixpost.

However, we have created a separate package [Mixpost Auth](https://github.com/inovector/mixpost-auth) that you can install very easily. Read the documentation of [this package](https://github.com/inovector/mixpost-auth) to find out how to install it.

You can determine which users of your application are allowed to view the Mixpost UI by defining a gate check called
viewMixpost in your `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` file.

```php
public function boot()
{
    \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate::define('viewMixpost', function ($user = null) {
        return optional($user)->email === 'dima@inovector.com';
    });
}
```

Mixpost will redirect unauthorized users to the route name specified in the `redirect_unauthorized_users_to_route` key of the
Mixpost config file.

## Visit the UI

After performing all these steps, you should be able to visit the Mixpost UI at /mixpost.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
